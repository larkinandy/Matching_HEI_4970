**Summary** <br>
This github repository contains the scripts used to compare birth outcomes between maternal neighbors upwind/downwind of the same high-traffic road

**Repository Structure** <br>
Files are divided into five folders, with each folder corresponding to a unique stage of the study

- **[birth records](https://github.com/larkinandy/Matching_HEI_4970/tree/master/birth%20records)** - preprocess birth cohort records <br>
- **[wind metrics](https://github.com/larkinandy/Matching_HEI_4970/tree/master/wind%20metrics)** - calculate number of hours residences were downwind from high-traffic roads.
- **[building and tree shielding](https://github.com/larkinandy/Matching_HEI_4970/tree/master/building%20and%20tree%20shielding)** - estimate how much buildings and trees shielded maternal residences from roads. <br>
- **[matching](https://github.com/larkinandy/Matching_HEI_4970/tree/master/matching)** - pair upwind/downwind neighbors on opposite sides of the same road. <br>
- **[statistical analysis](https://github.com/larkinandy/Matching_HEI_4970/tree/master/statistical%20analysis)** - linear and logistic regression models to estimate impacts of living downwind on birth outcomes <br>
